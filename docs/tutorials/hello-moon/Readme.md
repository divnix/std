# Hello Moon

_A slightly more complete [hello world][hello-world] tutorial._

This tutorial implements a very typical `local` Cell and its Cell Blocks for a somewhat bigger project.
It also makes use of more advanced functions of `std`.
Namely:

- `std.growOn` instead of `std.grow`
- `std.harvest` to provide compatibility layers of "soil"
- non-default Cell Block definitions
- the input debug facility

The terms _"Block Type"_, _"Cell"_, _"Cell Block"_, _"Target"_ and _"Action"_ have special meaning within the context of `std`.
With these clear definitions, we navigate and communicate the code structure much more easily.
In order to familiarize yourself with them, please have a quick glance at the [glossary][glossary].

## File Layout

Let's start again with a flake:

#### `./flake.nix`

```nix
{{#include ./flake.nix}}
```

This time we specified `cellsFrom = ./nix;`.
This is gentle so that our colleagues know immediately which files to either look or never look at depending on where they stand.

We also used `std.growOn` instead of `std.grow` so that we can add compatibility layers of "soil".

Furthermore, we only defined two Cell Blocks: `nixago` & `devshells`. More on them follows...

#### `./nix/local/*`

Next, we define a `local` cell.
Each project will have some amount of automation.
This can be repository automation, such as code generation.
Or it can be a CI/CD specification.
In here, we wire up two tools from the Nix ecosystem: [`numtide/devshell`][devshell] & [`nix-community/nixago`][nixago].

> The Nix ecosystem is very rich in _component tools_, however only few _integration tools_ exist at the time of writing.

#### `./nix/local/shells.nix`

Let's start with the `cell.devshells` Cell Block and work our way backwards to the `cell.nixago` Cell Block below.

> **More semantic background:**
>
> I could also reference them as `inputs.cells.local.devshells` & `inputs.cells.local.nixago`.

> Instead, we gently hint at the locality by just referring them via the `cell` context.

```nix
{{#include ./nix/_automation/devshells.nix}}
```

The `nixago = [];` option in this definition is a special integration provided by the [Standard's `devshell`-wrapper (`std.lib.mkShell`)][devshell-wrapper].

_This is how `std` delivers on its promise of being a (horizontal) integration tool that wraps (vertical) component tools into a polished user story and experience._

Because we made use of `std.harvest` in the flake, you now can actually test out the devshell via the Nix CLI compat layer by just running `nix develop -c "$SHELL"` in the directory of the flake.
For a more elegant method of entering a development shell read on the [direnv][direnv-sec] section below.

#### `./nix/local/nixago.nix`

As we have seen above, the `nixago` option in the `cell.devshells` Cell Block references Targets from both `lib.cfg`.
While you can explore `lib.cfg` [here][lib-cfg], let's now have a closer look at `cell.nixago`:

```nix
{{#include ./nix/_automation/nixago.nix}}
```

In this Cell Block, we have been modifying some built-in convenience `lib.cfg.*` pebbles.
The way `data` is merged upon the existing pebble is via a simple left-hand-side/right-hand-side `data-merge` (`std.dmerge`).

> **Background on array merge strategies:**
>
> If you know how a plain data-merge (does not magically) deal with array merge semantics, you noticed:
> We didn't have to annotate our right-hand-side arrays in this example because we where not actually amending or modifying any left-hand-side array type data structure.
>
> Would we have done so, we would have had to annotate:
>
> - either with `std.dmerge.append [/* ... */]`;
> - or with `std.dmerge.update [ idx ] [/* ... */]`.
>
> But lucky us (this time)!

## Command Line Synthesis

With this configuration in place, you have a couple of options on the command line.
Note, that you can access any `std` cli invocation also via the `std` TUI by just typing `std`.
Just in case you forgot exactly how to access one of these repository capabilities.

> **Debug Facility:**
>
> Since the debug facility is enabled, you will see some trace output while running these commands.
> To switch this off, just comment the `debug = [ /* ... */ ];` attribute in the flake.
>
> It looks something like this:
>
> ```nix
> trace: inputs on x86_64-linux
> trace: {
>   cells = {â€¦};
>   nixpkgs = {â€¦};
>   self = {â€¦};
>   std = {â€¦};
> }
> ```

**Invoke devshell via `nix`**

```bash
nix develop -c "$SHELL"
```

By quirks of the Nix CLI, if you don't specify `-c "$SHELL"`, you'll be thrown into an unfamiliar bare `bash` interactive shell.
That's not what you want.

**Invoke the devshell via `std`**

In this case, invoking `$SHELL` correctly is taken care for you by the Block Type's `enter` Action.

```bash
# fetch `std`
$ nix shell github:divnix/std
$ std //local/devshells/default:enter
```

Since we have declared the devshell Cell Block as a `blockTypes.devshells`, `std` auments it's Targets with the Block Type Actions.

See [`blockTypes.devshells`][blocktypes-devshells] for more details on the available Actions and their implementation.

Thanks to the `cell.devshells`' `nixago` option, entering the devshell will also automatically reconcile the repository files under Nixago's management.

**Explore a Nixago Pebble via `std`**

You can also explore the nixago configuration via the Nixago Block Type's `explore`-Action.

```bash
# fetch `std`
$ nix shell github:divnix/std
$ std //local/nixago/treefmt:explore
```

See [`blockTypes.nixago`][blocktypes-nixago] for more details on the available Actions and their implementation.

## direnv

Manually entering the devshell is boring.
How about a daemon always does that automatically & efficiently when you `cd` into a project directory?
Enter [`direnv`][direnv] &mdash; the original (again; and even from the same author) ðŸ˜Š.

Before you continue, first install direnv according to it's [install instructions][direnv-install].
It's super simple & super useful â„¢ and you should do it _right now_ if you haven't yet.

Please learn how to enable `direnv` in this project by following the [direnv how-to][direnv-how-to].

In this case, you would adapt the relevant line to: **`use std nix //local/shells:default`**.

Now, you can simply `cd` into that directory, and the devshells is being loaded.
The MOTD will be shown, too.

The first time, you need to teach the `direnv` daemon to trust the `.envrc` file via `direnv allow`.
If you want to reload the devshell (e.g. to reconcile Nixago Pebbles), you can just run `direnv reload`.

Because I use these commands so often, I've set: `alias d="direnv"` in my shell's RC file.
