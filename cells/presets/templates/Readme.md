# Nix Templates

These are opinionated template projects designed to get you kick-started.

You can make use of them through the Nix CLI, via:

```bash
cd my-new-project
nix flake init -t github:divnix/std#<template-name>
```

Please consult the template section in the [docs][docs] for an overview.
