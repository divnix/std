# `mkMakes` provides an interface to `makes` tasks

This is an integration for [`fluidattacks/makes`][makes].

A version that has this [patch][patch] is a prerequisite.

## Usage example

```nix
{
  inputs,
  cell,
}: let
  inherit (inputs.std.lib) dev;
in {
  task = ops.mkMakes ./path/to/make/task//main.nix {};
}
```

_Some refactoring of the tasks may be necessary. Let the error messages be your friend._
