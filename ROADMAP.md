# Roadmap

The freestyle history of the project was productive at its time.
But recently, it has been outgrowing its freedom to freestyle.

This roadmap gives an overview of the short and mid term direction that the project aims to take.

## Deliverable Categories

We've identified a couple of deliverable categories that should help us better understand the work spectrum associated with the project.
Please also complement this with the high level overview in the [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

##### Process Categories alongside the (automatable sections of the) SDLC

- Setup Processes
- The actual automatable parts of the SDLC Cycle

While an instance of the actual SDLC process inside the boundaries of Standard's current scope is easy to break down into _eval_, _build_ and _effect/action_ and easy to measure with the _cycle time_ metric,
the Setup Process is where adoption success or failure may be determined alongside:

- Provided Documentation
- Shared Mental Models
- Curated Quick Start Template
- Onboarding & Learning Context
- Actual Installation and Setup

##### Process Regions

As discussed in the [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) document, we roughly identify three regions with shifting characteristics alongside the SDLC:

- Development Environment Region
- Build Pipeline Region (including CI control loops)
- Continuous Delivery and Beyond (Application Lifecycle Management)

##### Deliverable Types

- Docs
- CLI Commands or TUI functionality
- Integrations
- Library Functions
- Block Types
- Stable Interfaces
- Community Outreach

## Milestone v1

With the above in mind, the [issue backlog](https://github.com/divnix/std/issues) will be regularly groomed and prioritized.
This is an aid for the core contributors, but it may also provide the necessary orientation and stability to convince interested new contributors.

Welcome!
