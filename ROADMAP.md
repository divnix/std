# Roadmap

The freestyle history of the project was productive at its time.
But recently, it has been outgrowing its freedom to freestyle.

This roadmap gives an overview of the short and mid term direction that the project aims to take.

## Deliverable Categories

We've identified a couple of deliverable categories in line with the [architectural overview](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

These help us to better understand the work spectrum associated with the project.

##### Process Categories

To run an _automation_ we have to _set it up_, first.
We should keep that in mind when working on the backlog and therefore classify:

- Setup
- Automation

Work packages that supports setup typically involve:

- Documentation & Setup Instructions
- Pattern & Shared Mental Models
- Quick Start Template
- Onboarding & Learning Content

##### Process Regions

Per our [architectural overview](./ARCHITECTURE.md), we distinguishe these process regions:

- Development Environment
- Build Pipeline
- Deployment and Beyond (Application Lifecycle Management)

##### Deliverable Types

- Docs
- CLI Commands or TUI functionality
- Integrations
- Library Functions
- Block Types
- Stable Interfaces
- Community Outreach

## Milestone v1

With the above in mind, the [issue backlog](https://github.com/divnix/std/issues) will be regularly groomed and prioritized.
This is an aid for the core contributors, but it may also provide the necessary orientation to get new contributors set up.

Welcome!
