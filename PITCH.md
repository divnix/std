# Value Matrix

This section will explain how Standard intends to create value for different stakeholders.
It is essential to have an idea of who they are, so let's introduce:

**_The Software Sponsor_**
Makes resources available in return for the expectation of future benefits.

**_The Provider of Automation_**
Sets up and maintains the automation along the SDLC.
A helpful analogy would be the person who sets up and maintains the conveyor belt which moves features to production.

**_The Consumer of Automation_**
Consumes and co-maintaines the automation along the SDLC.
A helpful analogy would be that this person not only uses and configures our conveyor belt, but is also capable of occasionally maintaining it.

It is essential to have an understanding of what they value, so let's try to get an overview.
We'll make use of a high level value matrix with simple sentiment scores:

- :heart_eyes: &rarr; <i>"absolutely love it!!!"</i>
- :smile: &rarr; <i>"feels pretty good."</i>
- :neutral_face: &rarr; <i>"whatever?!?"</i>

So, this is for you and your team, if you:

- Care about reproducibility for more reliablility throughout your software development
- Value clean code for keeping a check on techincal debt and increased long-term maintainability
- Have a deadline to meet with the help of the includes best practices and batteries
- Want to serve an optimized UX to your colleagues via a repo CLI / TUI and (close to) zero-config CI
