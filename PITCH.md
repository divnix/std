# Value Matrix

This section will explain how Standard intends to create value for different stakeholders.
It is essential to have an idea of who they are, so let's introduce:

**_The Software Sponsor_**
Makes resources available in return for the expectation of future benefits.

**_The Provider of Automation_**
Sets up and maintains the automation alongside the SDLC.
A helpful analogy would be the person who sets up and maintains the conveyor belt, which moves features to production.

**_The Consumer of Automation_**
Consumes and co-maintaines the automation alongside the SDLC.
A helpful analogy would be that this person not only uses and configures our conveyor belt, but is also capable of maintaining it.

It is equally essential to have an understanding what they value, so let's try to get an overview.
We'll make use of a high level value matrix with simple sentiment scores:

- :heart_eyes: &rarr; <i>"absolutely love it!!!"</i>
- :smile: &rarr; <i>"feels pretty good."</i>
- :neutral_face: &rarr; <i>"whatever?!?"</i>
